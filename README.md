# UnmarkedDynamicOccupancyModels
This repository details a multi-season occupancy model using using the colext function from the unmarked package in R, following the formulation of Mackenzie et al. 2003. Our dataset spans 25 years of data with 4 visits per year at 219 sites collected as part of the Calling Lake fragmentation experiment (Schmiegelow 1997). The purpose of the analysis was to determine the long-term effects of habitat fragmentation on the occupancy dynamics of Black-throated Green Warblers, using various human footprint metrics, stand variables, and detection covariates. Abundance data for Black-throated Green Warblers were transformed into binary presence/absence for modeling.
